brainfunc: a really bad brainfuck interpreter
=============================================

Copyright (C) 2011, John Bartholomew <jpa.bartholomew@gmail.com>

brainfunc compiles brainfuck code to bytecode and then interprets it.
It also extends the language to provide 'functions'.
Any functions must appear after the main body of the program
(nothing else makes sense syntactically, as you'll see...)

A function starts with an identifier immediately followed by a colon
(no space or other characters are allowed between the identifier and
the colon). A function ends when you define another function, or when
the source code ends.

An identifier not followed by a colon is a function call. Calls to a
function may appear before the function itself: function resolution
happens at the end of compilation.

An identifier is matched by the expression ([a-zA-Z\_]\[a-zA-Z0-9\_]\*)
The '#' character is used as a line comment marker, causing all
further characters on that line to be ignored.

By default, program source code size is limited to 1MB, and programs
run with a 1MB tape. To allow movement left, programs start half way
along the tape.

The size limits can be changed by altering the #defines at the top
of this file.

The need for function resolution means that all source code must be
available before the program begins execution (sorry about that).
